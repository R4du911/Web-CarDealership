# WebProject

Frontend of a car dealership connected to a Firestore database. 

What I learnt from this project:
 - Angular framework and Angular Materials
 - Firebase connection and CRUD operations on a Firestore database
 - Web designing
 - HTML, CSS, Typescript 

The website is made up of two pages, the first one being the front page, where the user can see 
the logo of the dealership, a short description and also some links to the dealership's social media.

The second page features the 'Warehouse' and displays a table with all the cars from the database.

User can press on 'add car' and a modal will show up with a form that enables the user to input all the new data.

User can also delete or update the cars by pressing on the buttons next to the desired car.
